# Contribute to Docstring-Markdown

Docstring-Markdown currently supports only Python files, expects sklearn-formated docstrings, and compiles markdown files to mimic sklearn's docs.

Additionally, Docstring-Markdown only supports automatic source code links for code stored in Github repositories.

I encourage users to contribute the following:

1. Additional docstring parsers (e.g. for PyTorch or Keras formatted docstrings).
2. Additional markdown compilers (e.g. for PyTorch or Keras style docs).
3. Support for more languages.
4. Additional source code href compilers (for projects hosted outside Github repositories).
